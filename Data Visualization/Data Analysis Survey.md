# Data Analysis Survey Project :incoming_envelope:

## Description ✍️

In this guided project I created an interactive dashboard in Power BI using a dataset that can be seen and downloaded up above. Data was gathered from a survey of participants that are in the data "world". 
The survey asks the participants many questions related to their job, salary, and skills, as well as a few demographical questions.

### Power Query :page_facing_up:
This project includes performing data cleaning in Power Query in a variety of ways. Change of data types was used to convert strings into integers so they could be properly used in the graphs on the dashboard. Irrelevant or empty columns were removed.
Wordy columns were fixed by splitting them by delimiter. DAX was used for simple calculations. Columns were renamed for easier understanding. Conditional formatting was used to split data into groups.

### Dashboard :bar_chart:
After the data was cleaned, it was ready to be inputted into the dashboard. Visualizations used includes bar charts, stacked barcharts, treemaps, cards, donut charts, and gauges. Each individual visualization was customized and organized to fit the theme for greater appeal.

A preview of the dashboard can be seen below:
