## About Me ðŸ‘¨

Hello! This is my personal portfolio to showcase my skills in data analysis through various projects. This portfolio is ongoing and I am currently working on other projects that will be added here when completed. Projects displayed here are also being constantly updated and improved as I learn and implement new skills. I am a recent graduate from the University of Alabama with a B.S in Computer Engineering (May 2023). I am currently looking for full-time jobs in the data-analytics community!
