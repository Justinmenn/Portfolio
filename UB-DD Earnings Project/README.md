# DD_UE Earnings Excel Project 💰💰💰

## Description ✍️

### Microsoft Excel
In this project I utilized some of my personal earnings information from my time working part-time with both DoorDash and UberEats food delivery services. In the Excel file there are nine total sheets. 
- The first sheet labeled "Dashboard" is the final interactive and dynamic dashboard that features various charts and graphs, as well as timelines and slicers to filter data to the user's liking.
- The sheet labeled "DataSet" is the data table that has 10 columns of information of various data. Each row in the column is a day that I worked, and each row was manually inputted from records that I have been keeping.
- The other seven sheets are the pivot tables that were used to make the dashboard, and are labeled to match their appearance on the dashboard.

The dataset, and therefore the dashboard, is updated weekly and populated with new rows to reflect my weekly statistics.

** Please note that the dashboard MAY have some missing data when first opening the file. To fix this, press "Enable Editing" and everything should display correctly **

### Tableau
I also created an interactive dashboard in Tableau to mimic that of the Excel dasboard. The link to the Tableau visualization can be found below.
