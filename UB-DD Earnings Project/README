## DD_UE Earnings Excel Project

### Description: In this project I utilized some of my personal earnings information from my time working with both DoorDash and UberEats food delivery services. In the Excel file there are nine total sheets. The first sheet labeled "Dashboard" is the final dashboard that features various charts and graphs, as well as timelines and slicers to filter data to the user's liking. The sheet labeled "DataSet" is the data table that has 10 columns of information of various data. Each row in the column is a day that I worked. The other seven sheets are the pivot tables that were used to make the dashboard. The dataset is updated weekly and populated with new rows.
