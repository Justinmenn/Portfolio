## MLB Baseball SQL Project

### Description
Baseball has always been one of my passions. I grew up playing and watching the sport, and I have attended countless MLB games in my life. Baseball is a statistics-driven sports, and that aspect of it has always fascinated me. For this project I have taken it upon myself to answer 12 questions that I have proposed to myself. All questions were answered by using six data tables that contain MLB data, and pgAdmin4 and postgreSQL for querying. The project contains three SQL file scripts that I wrote. The first file contains the skeleton for creating the six tables. Once the data is imported into these tables, the second file involves wrangling and cleaning the data. The third file contains all of the queries to answer the questions I asked myself.
